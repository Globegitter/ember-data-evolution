{"name":"Ember Data Nemesis","tagline":"An experimental patch set for ember-data","body":"Ember Data is a library for loading data from a persistence layer (such as\r\na JSON API), mapping this data to a set of models within your client application,\r\nupdating those models, then saving the changes back to a persistence layer. It \r\nprovides many of the facilities you'd find in server-side ORMs like ActiveRecord, but is\r\ndesigned specifically for the unique environment of JavaScript in the browser.\r\n\r\nEmber Data Nemesis is a patch set maintained by me (@tchak). It contains some fixes and some new experimental features.\r\nIt is not meant to be a fork. Nemesis is regulary synced with the master of regular Ember Data.\r\nThere is no guaranty on the api. All the features are meant to be merged in the main repo at some point.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
